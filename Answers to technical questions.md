# Answers to Technical Questions

## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent approximately 6 hours on the coding test. This included designing the task management application, implementing the core features, and testing the application thoroughly to ensure its functionality.

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

The most useful feature I found in JavaScript (ES6+) is the `async/await` syntax for handling asynchronous operations. It simplifies the handling of promises and makes the code cleaner and more readable.

Hereâ€™s an example of how I've used `async/await` in my application:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        let data = await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    }
}

```
## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

- **Identify the Bottleneck**: Start by using browser tools like **Chrome DevTools** to measure page load times, JavaScript performance, and rendering issues.
- **Use Profiling Tools**: Use tools such as **Google Lighthouse** or **WebPageTest** to generate a performance report of your application and identify areas for improvement.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring tools like **LogRocket**, **Sentry**, or **NewRelic** to capture real-time performance data and errors.
- **Server-Side Monitoring**: Check server logs for slow queries or backend issues using tools like **Datadog** or **NewRelic**.
- **Optimize Resources**: After identifying the problem areas, optimize resources by reducing JavaScript payloads, lazy-loading assets, or using efficient algorithms to minimize load times.

## 4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

- **User Authentication**: Implement user login and registration so users can securely store and manage their tasks.
- **Task Sorting**: Add functionality to sort tasks by priority, due date, or completion status.
- **Task Categories or Tags**: Allow users to categorize tasks or add tags for better organization.
- **Reminders and Notifications**: Enable due date reminders or notifications via email or in-app alerts to help users stay on track.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improve the UI/UX for mobile devices, ensuring that the application is fully responsive.
